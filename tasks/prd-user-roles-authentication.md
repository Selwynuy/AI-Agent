# Product Requirements Document: User Roles & Authentication System

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a comprehensive user role system for the real estate platform, replacing mock authentication data with a proper working authentication system. The system will support multiple user roles (Admin, Agent, Developer, Seller, Buyer) with role-specific permissions and dashboards, while maintaining a unified navigation experience through profile-based role management.

## Goals

1. **Replace mock authentication** with a fully functional authentication system
2. **Implement role-based access control** with 5 distinct user roles
3. **Create role-specific dashboards** and functionality for each user type
4. **Maintain unified UX** with role management under profile section
5. **Enable role-specific actions** (listing management, property searches, etc.)
6. **Implement approval workflows** for appropriate roles
